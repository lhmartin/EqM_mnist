Testing out Equilibrium Matching on MNIST

### ToDo:

- [ ] Directly compare the quality of the samples from the equilibrium matching and flow matching
- [ ] Train variants of the equilibrium matching models, with different C-methods, compare the quality of the samples
- [ ] Train variants of the equilibrium matching models, with different magnitude functions, compare the quality of the samples
- [ ] Plot the grad norm during the inference process, compare early stopping with the gradient norm threshold
- [ ] Clean up code, and add more documentation
- [ ] Write a blog post about the results
